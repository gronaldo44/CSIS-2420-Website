# CSIS-2420-Website
Cookie Assignment
This is an extremely simple and ugly website that a theoretical company might use to sell cookies.
This is not a web design project. This is a web dev project, hence the ugly design.
The goals of this project were: 
  Learn how to read from and add to a live MySQL database on a website. 
  Practice JavaScript and php.
  Learn how to build a shopping cart and user login interface.
